- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

An attacker deliberately crashes a server by overloading it or passing bad input.
The secure version uses a try catch loop that stops the server from crashing.

An additional layer of security would be to rate limit requests from specific IP adresses.
