- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version is better at preventing repudiation than the insecure version.
- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

When a server does not log happenings properly. It allows for people to falsify their actions.

The secure version provides better logs of who sent what and what date/time the request was sent.

To make it even better there could be a session/cookie verification of the user to ensure an attacker cannot falsify their logs as someone else's etc.
